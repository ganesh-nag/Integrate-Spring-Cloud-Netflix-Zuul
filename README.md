# Example-SpringCloudNetflix-Zuul-Ribbon-Eureka

@author Ganesh Nagalingam

Proof of Concept shows Spring boot application that explores Zuul router integration with Ribbon to identify services through service id from Eureka discoverer.
Two types of Clients, such as Feign and Rest Template have been used to compare service invocation styles.
Four different modules have been created and integrated. Multiple instances have been created to test load balance capability.

This is a working example that shows microservices development using the following technology stack. For learning purpose, you can import these projects as Maven projects to test in your local machine.

| Technology stack |

Java SE 11, Spring boot, Zuul proxy router,

Ribbon load balancer, Feign, Rest template ( 2 different clients used to compare and contrast), 

Eureka discoverer server.

------------------------------------
This spring boot project amalgamate with Angular client project https://github.com/ganesh-nag/Angular-Forex.
An article has been published in https://medium.com/geekculture/amalgamate-angular-with-spring-cloud-architecture-through-cors-7f13b5fdb98f which will explain in detail.
